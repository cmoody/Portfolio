	<h1>Summary</h1>
	<p>I am a versatile and fast-paced business and web developer. I am great at building foundations, while seeing the bigger picture for a project. Whether it's internal or external projects, I thrive in every arena of the business cycle and have past experience in startup culture. My curiosity has always propelled my career in technology while always keeping things fresh. When I was young, I asked my father "How do I connect our computers?" That question would take me from a kid that loved video games and lead me down a path of all-things technology.</p>
